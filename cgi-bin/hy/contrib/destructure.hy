This module is heavily inspired by destructuring from Clojure and provides very
similar semantics. It provides several macros that allow for destructuring within
their arguments.

Introduction
============

To use these macros, you need to require them like so:

.. code-block:: hy

    (require [hy.contrib.destructure [setv+ fn+ defn+ let+ defn/a+ fn/a+]])

Destructuring allows one to easily peek inside a data structure and assign names to values within. For example,

.. code-block:: hy

    (setv+ {[{name :name [weapon1 weapon2] :weapons} :as all-players] :players
            map-name :map
            :keys [tasks-remaining tasks-completed]}
           data)

would be equivalent to

.. code-block:: hy

    (setv map-name (.get data ':map)
          tasks-remaining (.get data ':tasks-remaining)
          tasks-completed (.get data ':tasks-completed)
          all-players (.get data ':players)
          name (.get (nth all-players 0) ':name)
          weapon1 (get (.get (nth all-players 0) ':weapons) 0)
          weapon2 (get (.get (nth all-players 0) ':weapons) 1))

where ``data`` might be defined by

.. code-block:: hy

    (setv data {:players [{:name Joe :weapons [:sword :dagger]}
                          {:name Max :weapons [:axe :crossbow]}]
                :map \"Dungeon\"
                :tasks-remaining 4})

This is similar to unpacking iterables in Python, such as ``a, *b, c = range(10)``, however it also works on dictionaries, and has several special options.

Patterns
========

Dictionary Pattern
------------------

Dictionary patterns are specified using dictionaries, where the keys corresponds to the symbols which are to be bound, and the values correspond to which key needs to be looked up in the expression for the given symbol.

.. code-block:: hy

    (setv+ {a :a b \"b\" c (, 1 0)} {:a 1 \"b\" 2 (, 1 0) 3})
    [a b c] ; => [1 2 3]

The keys can also be one of the following 4 special options: ``:or``, ``:as``, ``:keys``, ``:strs``.

- ``:or`` takes a dictionary of default values.
- ``:as`` takes a variable name which is bound to the entire expression.
- ``:keys`` takes a list of variable names which are looked up as keywords in the expression.
- ``:strs`` is the same as ``:keys`` but uses strings instead.

The ordering of the special options and the variable names doesn't matter, however each special option can be used at most once.

.. code-block:: hy

    (setv+ {:keys [a b] :strs [c d] :or {b 2 d 4} :as full} {:a 1 :b 2 \"c\" 3})
    [a b c d full] ; => [1 2 3 4 {:a 1 :b 2 \"c\" 3}]

Variables which are not found in the expression are set to ``None`` if no default value is specified.

List Pattern
------------

List patterns are specified using lists. The nth symbol in the pattern is bound to the nth value in the expression, or ``None`` if the expression has fewer than n values.

There are 2 special options: ``:&`` and ``:as``.

- ``:&`` takes a pattern which is bound to the rest of the expression. This pattern can be anything, including a dictionary, which allows for keyword arguments.
- ``:as`` takes a variable name which is bound to the entire expression.

If the special options are present, they must be last, with ``:&`` preceding ``:as`` if both are present.

.. code-block:: hy

    (setv+ [a b :& rest :as full] (range 5))
    [a b rest full] ; => [0 1 [2 3 4] [0 1 2 3 4]]

    (setv+ [a b :& {:keys [c d] :or {c 3}}] [1 2 :d 4 :e 5]
    [a b c d] ; => [1 2 3 4]

Note that this pattern calls ``list`` on the expression before binding the variables, and hence cannot be used with infinite iterators.

Iterator Pattern
----------------

Iterator patterns are specified using round brackets. They are the same as list patterns, but can be safely used with infinite generators. The iterator pattern does not allow for recursive destructuring within the ``:as`` special option.

(defmacro! ifp [o!pred o!expr #* clauses]
  "Takes a binary predicate ``pred``, an expression ``expr``, and a set of
  clauses. Each clause can be of the form ``cond res`` or ``cond :>> res``. For
  each clause, if ``(pred cond expr)`` evaluates to true, returns ``res`` in
  the first case or ``(res (pred cond expr))`` in the second case. If the last
  clause is just ``res``, then it is returned as a default, else ``None.``

  Examples:
    ::

       => (ifp instance? 5

  Destructuring bind.

  Implements the core logic, which would be useful for macros that want to make
  use of destructuring.

  Binding forms may be nested.
  :as and :& are magic in [] and () binds. See dest-list and dest-iter.
  :as :or :strs and :keys are magic in {} binds. See des-dict.

  In [] and () binds the magic keywords must come after the sequential symbols
  and :as must be last, if present.

  binds ``x`` to ``1`` and ``y`` to ``2``.
  To avoid duplication in common cases,
  the ``{:strs [foo bar]}`` option will look up \"foo\" and \"bar\"
  and bind them to the same name, just like ``{foo \"foo\" bar \"bar\"}``.
  Similarly, ``:keys [foo bar]`` works like ``{foo :foo bar :bar}``.
  Use the ``:as foo`` option to bind the whole mapping to ``foo``.
  Use the ``:or {foo 42}`` option to to bind ``foo`` to ``42`` if
  ``foo`` is requested, but not present in expr.
