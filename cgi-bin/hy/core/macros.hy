(defmacro as-> [head name #* rest]
  "Beginning with `head`, expand a sequence of assignments `rest` to `name`.

  .. versionadded:: 0.12.0

  Each assignment is passed to the subsequent form. Returns the final assignment,
  leaving the name bound to it in the local scope.

  This behaves similarly to other threading macros, but requires specifying
  the threading point per-form via the name, rather than fixing to the first
  or last argument.

  Examples:
    example how ``->`` and ``as->`` relate::

       => (as-> 0 it
       ...      (inc it)
       ...      (inc it))

(defmacro assoc [coll k1 v1 #* other-kvs]
  "Associate key/index value pair(s) to a collection `coll` like a dict or list.

  ``assoc`` is used to associate a key with a value in a dictionary or to set an
  index of a list to a value. It takes at least three parameters: the *data
  structure* to be modified, a *key* or *index*, and a *value*. If more than
  three parameters are used, it will associate in pairs.

  Examples:
    ::

       => (do
       ...   (setv collection {})
       ...   (assoc collection \"Dog\" \"Bark\")

(defmacro with [args #* body]
  "Wrap execution of `body` within a context manager given as bracket `args`.

  ``with`` is used to wrap the execution of a block within a context manager. The
  context manager can then set up the local system and tear it down in a controlled
  manner. The archetypical example of using ``with`` is when processing files.
  ``with`` can bind context to an argument or ignore it completely, as shown below:

  Examples:
    ::

       => (with [arg (expr)] block)
       => (with [(expr)] block)
       => (with [arg (expr) (expr)] block)

    The following example will open the ``NEWS`` file and print its content to the
    screen. The file is automatically closed after it has been processed::

       => (with [f (open \"NEWS\")] (print (.read f)))

    ``with`` returns the value of its last form, unless it suppresses an exception
    (because the context manager's ``__exit__`` method returned true), in which
    case it returns ``None``. So, the previous example could also be written::

       => (print (with [f (open \"NEWS\")] (.read f)))


    Shorthand for nested ``with*`` loops::

       => (with [x foo y bar] baz)
       (with* [x foo]
         (with* [y bar]
           baz)).
  "
  (_with 'with* args body))


(defmacro with/a [args #* body]
  "Wrap execution of `body` with/ain a context manager given as bracket `args`.

  ``with/a`` behaves like ``with``, but is used to wrap the execution of
  a block within an asynchronous context manager. The context manager can
  then set up the local system and tear it down in a controlled manner
  asynchronously.

  Examples:
    ::

       => (with/a [arg (expr)] block
       => (with/a [(expr)] block
       => (with/a [arg (expr) (expr)] block

    Shorthand for nested ``with/a*`` loops::

       => (with/a [x foo y bar] baz)
       (with/a* [x foo]
         (with/a* [y bar]
           baz)).

  .. note::
    ``with/a`` returns the value of its last form, unless it suppresses an exception
    (because the context manager's ``__aexit__`` method returned true), in which
    case it returns ``None``."
  (_with 'with/a* args body))

(defmacro cond [#* branches]
  "Build a nested if clause with each `branch` a [cond result] bracket pair.

  Examples:

       (if condition-1 result-1
         (if condition-2 result-2))

    If only the condition is given in a branch, then the condition is also used as
    the result. The expansion of this single argument version is demonstrated
    below::

       => (cond [condition-1]
       ...       [condition-2])
       (if condition-1 condition-1
         (if condition-2 condition-2))

    As shown below, only the first matching result block is executed::

       ...   (cond [(< value 5) (print \"value is smaller than 5\")]
       ...         [(= value 5) (print \"value is equal to 5\")]

(defmacro -> [head #* args]
  "Thread `head` first through the `rest` of the forms.

  ``->`` (or the *threading macro*) is used to avoid nesting of expressions. The
  threading macro inserts each expression into the next expression's first argument
  place. The following code demonstrates this:

  ``->>`` (or the *threading tail macro*) is similar to the *threading macro*, but
  instead of inserting each expression into the next expression's first argument,
  it appends it as the last argument. The following code demonstrates this:

(defmacro of [base #* args]
  "Shorthand for indexing for type annotations.

  If only one arguments are given, this expands to just that argument. If two arguments are
  given, it expands to indexing the first argument via the second. Otherwise, the first argument
  is indexed using a tuple of the rest.

  ``of`` has three forms:

  - ``(of T)`` will simply become ``T``.
  - ``(of T x)`` will become ``(get T x)``.
  - ``(of T x y ...)`` (where the ``...`` represents zero or more arguments) will become
    ``(get T (, x y ...))``.

(defmacro defmain [args #* body]
  "Write a function named \"main\" and do the 'if __main__' dance.

  .. versionadded:: 0.10.1

  The ``defmain`` macro defines a main function that is immediately called
  with ``sys.argv`` as arguments if and only if this file is being executed
  as a script.  In other words, this:

  Examples:
    ::

       => (defmain [#* args]
       ...  (do-something-with args))

    is the equivalent of:

    .. code-block:: python

       => def main(*args):
       ...    do_something_with(args)
       ...    return 0
       ...
       ... if __name__ == \"__main__\":
       ...     import sys
       ...     retval = main(*sys.argv)
       ...
       ...     if isinstance(retval, int):
       ...         sys.exit(retval)

    Note that as you can see above, if you return an integer from this
    function, this will be used as the exit status for your script.
    (Python defaults to exit status 0 otherwise, which means everything's
    okay!) Since ``(sys.exit 0)`` is not run explicitly in the case of a
    non-integer return from ``defmain``, it's a good idea to put ``(defmain)``
    as the last piece of code in your file.

    If you want fancy command-line arguments, you can use the standard Python
    module ``argparse`` in the usual way::

       => (import argparse)
       => (defmain [#* _]
       ...   (setv parser (argparse.ArgumentParser))
       ...   (.add-argument parser \"STRING\"
       ...     :help \"string to replicate\")
       ...   (.add-argument parser \"-n\" :type int :default 3
       ...     :help \"number of copies\")
       ...   (setv args (parser.parse_args))
       ...   (print (* args.STRING args.n))
       ...   0)
"
  (setv retval (gensym)
        restval (gensym))
  `(when (= --name-- "__main__")
     (import sys)
     (setv ~retval ((fn [~@(or args `[#* ~restval])] ~@body) #* sys.argv))
     (if (integer? ~retval)
       (sys.exit ~retval))))


(defmacro "#@" [expr]
  "with-decorator tag macro"
  (if (empty? expr)
      (macro-error expr "missing function argument"))
  (setv decorators (cut expr None -1)
        fndef (get expr -1))
  `(with-decorator ~@decorators ~fndef))


(defmacro comment [#* body]
  "Ignores body and always expands to None

  The ``comment`` macro ignores its body and always expands to ``None``.
  Unlike linewise comments, the body of the ``comment`` macro must
  be grammatically valid Hy, so the compiler can tell where the comment ends.
  Besides the semicolon linewise comments,
  Hy also has the ``#_`` discard prefix syntax to discard the next form.
  This is completely discarded and doesn't expand to anything, not even ``None``.

  Examples:
    ::

        => (print (comment <h1>Surprise!</h1>
        ...                <p>You'd be surprised what's grammatically valid in Hy.</p>
        ...                <p>(Keep delimiters in balance, and you're mostly good to go.)</p>)
        ...        \"Hy\")
        None Hy

    ::

        => (print #_(comment <h1>Surprise!</h1>
        ...                  <p>You'd be surprised what's grammatically valid in Hy.</p>
        ...                  <p>(Keep delimiters in balance, and you're mostly good to go.)</p>))
        ...        \"Hy\")
        Hy"
  None)


(defmacro doc [symbol]
  "macro documentation

   Gets help for a macro function available in this module.
   Use ``require`` to make other macros available.

   Use ``(help foo)`` instead for help with runtime objects."
   (setv symbol (str symbol))
   (setv mangled (mangle symbol))
   (setv builtins (gensym "builtins"))
   `(do (import [builtins :as ~builtins])
        (help (or (.get __macros__ ~mangled)
                  (.get (. ~builtins __macros__) ~mangled)
                  (raise (NameError f"macro {~symbol !r} is not defined"))))))


(defmacro cfor [f #* generator]
  #[[syntactic sugar for passing a ``generator`` expression to the callable ``f``

  Its syntax is the same as :ref:`generator expression <py:genexpr>`, but takes
  a function ``f`` that the generator will be immedietly passed to. Equivalent
  to ``(f (gfor ...))``.

  Examples:
  ::
     => (cfor tuple x (range 10) :if (odd? x) x)
     (, 1 3 5 7 9)

  The equivalent in python would be:

     >>> tuple(x for x in range(10) if is_odd(x))

  Some other common functions that take iterables::

     => (cfor all x [1 3 8 5] (< x 10))
     True

     => (with [f (open "AUTHORS")]
     ...  (cfor max
     ...        author (.splitlines (f.read))
     ...        :setv name (.group (re.match r"\* (.*?) <" author) 1)
     ...        :if (name.startswith "A")
     ...        (len name)))
     20 ;; The number of characters in the longest author's name that starts with 'A'
  ]]
  `(~f (gfor ~@generator)))
